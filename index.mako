Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to
code review.  We run our hooks on every commit to automatically point out
issues in code such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespace, and debug
statements.  By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a
code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time
with trivial style nitpicks.

As we created more libraries and projects we recognized that sharing our
pre-commit hooks across projects is painful. We copied and pasted unwieldy
bash scripts from project to project and had to manually change the hooks to
work for different project structures.

We believe that you should always use the best industry standard linters.
Some of the best linters are written in languages that you do not use in your
project or have installed on your machine. For example scss-lint is a linter
for SCSS written in Ruby. If you’re writing a project in Node.js you should be
able to use scss-lint as a pre-commit hook without adding a Gemfile to your
project or understanding how to get scss-lint installed.

We built pre-commit to solve our hook issues. It is a multi-language package
manager for pre-commit hooks. You specify a list of hooks you want and
pre-commit manages the installation and execution of any hook written in any
language before every commit. pre-commit is specifically designed to not
require root access. If one of your developers doesn’t have Node.js installed
but modifies a JavaScript file, pre-commit automatically handles downloading
and building Node.js to run ESLint without root.

${md('''
Once you have pre-commit installed, adding pre-commit plugins to your project
is done with the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration file.

Add a file called `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the root of your project. The
pre-commit config file describes what repositories and hooks are installed.

## .pre-commit-config.yaml - top level

_new in 1.0.0_ The default configuration file top-level was changed from a
list to a map.  If you're using an old version of pre-commit, the top-level
list is the same as the value of [`repos`](#pre-commit-configyaml---repos).
If you'd like to migrate to the new configuration format, run
[`pre-commit migrate-config`](#pre-commit-migrate-config) to automatically
migrate your configuration.

```table
=r=
    =c= `exclude`
    =c= (optional: default `^$`) global file exclude pattern.  _new in 1.1.0_.
=r=
    =c= `fail_fast`
    =c= (optional: default `false`) set to `true` to have pre-commit stop
        running hooks after the first failure.  _new in 1.1.0_.
=r=
    =c= `repos`
    =c= A list of [repository mappings](#pre-commit-configyaml---repos).
```

A sample top-level with all defaults present:

```yaml
exclude: '^$'
fail_fast: false
repos:
-   ...
```

## .pre-commit-config.yaml - repos

The repository mapping tells pre-commit where to get the code for the hook
from.

```table
=r=
    =c= `repo`
    =c= the repository URL to `git clone` from
=r=
    =c= `rev`
    =c= the revision or tag to clone at.  _new in 1.7.0_ previously `sha`
=r=

A sample repository with all defaults present:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v1.2.3
    hooks:
    -   ...
```

## .pre-commit-config.yaml - hooks

The hook mapping configures which hook from the repository is used and allows
for customization.  All optional keys will receive their default from the
repository's configuration.

```table
=r=
    =c= `id`
    =c= which hook from the repository to use.

=r=
    =c= `additional_dependencies`
    =c= (optional) a list of dependencies that will be installed in the
        environment where this hook gets run.  One useful application is to
        install plugins for hooks such as `eslint`.  _new in 0.6.6_.
=r=
    =c= `always_run`
    =c= (optional) if `true`, this hook will run even if there are no matching
        files.  _new in 0.7.2_.
=r=
    =c= `verbose`
    =c= (optional) if `true`, forces the output of the hook to be printed even when
        the hook passes.  _new in 1.6.0_.
=r=
    =c= `log_file`
    =c= (optional) if present, the hook output will additionally be written
        to a file.  _new in 0.14.0_
```

One example of a complete configuration:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v1.2.3
    hooks:
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
```

This configuration says to download the pre-commit-hooks project and run its
trailing-whitespace hook.

## Updating hooks automatically

You can update your hooks to the latest version automatically by running
`pre-commit autoupdate`.  This will bring the hooks to the latest tag on the
master branch.

Run `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit into your Git hooks. pre-commit
will now run on every commit. Every time you clone a project using pre-commit
running `pre-commit install` should always be the first thing you do.

If you want to manually run all pre-commit hooks on a repository, run
`pre-commit run --all-files`. To run individual hooks use
`pre-commit run <hook_id>`.

The first time pre-commit runs on a file it will automatically download,
install, and run the hook. Note that running a hook for the first time may be
slow. For example: If the machine does not have Node.js installed, pre-commit
will download and build a copy of Node.js.

want.

The hook must exit nonzero on failure or modify files in the working directory

### docker

_new in 0.10.0_

The hook repository must have a `Dockerfile`.  It will be installed via
`docker build .`.

Running Docker hooks requires a running Docker engine on your host.  For
configuring Docker hooks, your `entry` should correspond to an executable
inside the Docker container, and will be used to override the default container
entrypoint. Your Docker `CMD` will not run when pre-commit passes a file list
as arguments to the run container  command. Docker allows you to use any
language that's not supported by pre-commit as a builtin.

__Support:__ docker hooks are known to work on any system which has a working
`docker` executable.  It has been tested on linux and macOS.  Hooks that are
run via `boot2docker` are known to be unable to make modifications to files.

See [this repository](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-docker-flake8)
for an example Docker-based hook.

### docker_image

_new in 0.18.0_

A more lightweight approach to `docker` hooks.  The `docker_image`
"language" uses existing docker images to provide hook executables.

`docker_image` hooks can be conviently configured as [local](#repository-local)
hooks.

The `entry` specifies the docker tag to use.  If an image has an
`ENTRYPOINT` defined, nothing special is needed to hook up the executable.
If the container does not specify an `ENTRYPOINT` or you want to change the
entrypoint you can specify it as well in your `entry`.

For example:

```yaml
-   id: dockerfile-provides-entrypoint
    name: ...
    language: docker_image
    entry: my.registry.example.com/docker-image-1:latest
-   id: dockerfile-no-entrypoint-1
    name: ...
    language: docker_image
    entry: --entrypoint my-exe my.registry.example.com/docker-image-2:latest
# Alternative equivalent solution
-   id: dockerfile-no-entrypoint-2
    name: ...
    language: docker_image
    entry: my.registry.example.com/docker-image-3:latest my-exe
```

### golang

_new in 0.12.0_

The hook repository must contain go source code.  It will be installed via
`go get ./...`.  pre-commit will create an isolated `GOPATH` for each hook and
the `entry` should match an executable which will get installed into the
`GOPATH`'s `bin` directory.

__Support:__ golang hooks are known to work on any system which has go
installed.  It has been tested on linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Node.js

The hook repository must have a `package.json`.  It will be installed via
`npm install .`.  The installed package will provide an executable that will
match the `entry` – usually through `bin` in package.json.

__Support:__ Node.js hooks work without any system-level dependencies.  It has
been tested on linux and macOS and _may_ work under cygwin.

_new in 1.5.0_ Windows is now supported for Node.js hooks.  Currently Python 3
only due to [a bug in CPython](https://bugs.python.org/issue32539).

### Python

The hook repository must have a `setup.py`.  It will be installed via
`pip install .`.  The installed package will provide an executable that will
match the `entry` – usually through `console_scripts` or `scripts` in setup.py.

__Support:__ Python hooks work without any system-level depedendencies.  It
has been tested on linux, macOS, Windows, and cygwin.


### python_venv

_new in 1.9.0_

An alternate implementation of the [Python](#python) language which uses the
Python 3 [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module.
On many systems you need to additionally install the `python3-venv` system
package to use this language.  This is otherwise a drop-in replacement for the
`python` language for situations where [`virtualenv` may not
work](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/631).

__Support:__ Python hooks work without any system-level depedendencies.  It
has been tested on linux, macOS, Windows, and cygwin.  Only Python 3
environments can be created with this language.

### ruby

The hook repository must have a `*.gemspec`.  It will be installed via
`gem build *.gemspec && gem install *.gem`.  The installed package will
produce an executable that will match the `entry` – usually through
`exectuables` in your gemspec.

__Support:__ ruby hooks work without any system-level dependencies.  It has
been tested on linux and macOS and _may_ work under cygwin.

### rust

_new in 1.10.0_

Rust hooks are installed using the system installation of
[Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo), Rust's official package manager.

Hook repositories must have a `Cargo.toml` file which produces at least one
binary ([example](https://github.com/chriskuehl/example-rust-pre-commit-hook)),
whose name should match the `entry` definition for your hook. The repo will be
installed via `cargo install --bins` (with the binaries stored in your
pre-commit cache, not polluting your user-level Cargo installations).

When specifying `additional_dependencies` for Rust, you can use the syntax
`{package_name}:{package_version}` to specify a new library dependency (used to
build _your_ hook repo), or the special syntax
`cli:{package_name}:{package_version}` for a CLI dependency (built separately,
with binaries made available for use by hooks).

__Support:__ Rust hooks currently require a pre-existing Rust installation.  It
has been tested on linux, Windows, and macOS.

### swift

_new in 0.11.0_

The hook repository must have a `Package.swift`.  It will be installed via
`swift build -c release`.  The `entry` should match an executable created by
building the repository.

__Support:__ swift hooks are known to work on any system which has swift
installed.  It has been tested on linux and macOS.

### pcre

_**deprecated**_: the pcre language will be removed in a later version.  Use
[pygrep](#pygrep) hooks instead (usually a drop-in replacement).

"Perl Compatible Regular Expressions" – pcre hooks are a quick way to write a
simple hook which prevents commits by file matching.  Specify the regex as the
`entry`.

macos does not ship with a functioning `grep -P` so you'll need
`brew install grep` for pcre hooks to function.

__Support:__ pcre hooks work on any system which has a functioning
`grep -P` (or in the case of macOS: `ggrep -P`).  It has been tested on linux,
macOS, Windows, and cygwin.

### pygrep

_new in 1.2.0_

A cross-platform Python implementation of `grep` – pygrep hooks are a quick
way to write a simple hook which prevents commits by file matching.  Specify
the regex as the `entry`.  The `entry` may be any Python
[regular expression](#regular-expressions).  For case insensitive regexes you
can apply the `(?i)` flag as the start of your entry, or use `args: [-i]`.

_new in 1.8.0_ For multiline matches, use `args: [--multiline]`.

__Support:__ pygrep hooks are supported on all platforms which pre-commit runs
on.

### script

Script hooks provide a way to write simple scripts which validate files. The
`entry` should be a path relative to the root of the hook repository.

This hook type will not be given a virtual environment to work with – if it
needs additional dependencies the consumer must install them manually.

__Support:__ the support of script hooks depend on the scripts themselves.

### system

System hooks provide a way to write hooks for system-level executables which
don't have a supported language above (or have special environment
requirements that don't allow them to run in isolation such as pylint).

This hook type will not be given a virtual environment to work with – if it
needs additional dependencies the consumer must install them manually.

__Support:__ the support of system hooks depend on the executables.

## Developing hooks interactively

Since the `repo` property of `.pre-commit-config.yaml` can refer to anything
that `git clone ...` understands, it's often useful to point it at a local
directory while developing hooks.

[`pre-commit try-repo`](#pre-commit-try-repo) streamlines this process by
enabling a quick way to try out a repository.  Here's how one might work
interactively:

```console
~/work/hook-repo $ git checkout origin/master -b feature

# ... make some changes

~/work/hook-repo $ # A commit is needed so `pre-commit` can clone
~/work/hook-repo $ git commit -m "Add new hook: foo"

# In another terminal or tab

~/work/other-repo $ pre-commit try-repo ../hook-repo foo --verbose --all-files
===============================================================================

## Running in migration mode

By default, if you have existing hooks `pre-commit install` will install in a
migration mode which runs both your existing hooks and hooks for pre-commit.
To disable this behavior, simply pass `-f` / `--overwrite` to the `install`
command. If you decide not to use pre-commit, `pre-commit uninstall` will
restore your hooks to the state prior to installation.

## Temporarily disabling hooks

Not all hooks are perfect so sometimes you may need to skip execution of one
or more hooks. pre-commit solves this by querying a `SKIP` environment
variable. The `SKIP` environment variable is a comma separated list of hook
ids. This allows you to skip a single hook instead of `--no-verify`ing the
entire commit.

```console
$ SKIP=flake8 git commit -m "foo"
```

## pre-commit during commits

Running hooks on unstaged changes can lead to both false-positives and
false-negatives during committing.  pre-commit only runs on the staged
contents of files by temporarily saving the contents of your files at commit
time and stashing the unstaged changes while running hooks.

## pre-commit during merges

The biggest gripe we’ve had in the past with pre-commit  hooks was during
merge conflict resolution.  When working on very large projects a merge often
results in hundreds of committed files. I shouldn’t need to run hooks on all
of these files that I didn’t even touch!  This often led to running commit
with `--no-verify` and allowed introduction of real bugs that hooks could have
caught.

pre-commit solves this by only running hooks on files that conflict or were
manually edited during conflict resolution.  This also includes files which
were automatically merged by Git.  Git isn't perfect and this can often catch
implicit conflicts (such as with removed Python imports).

## pre-commit during push

_new in 0.3.5_ pre-commit can be used to manage `pre-push` hooks.  Simply
`pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push`.

## pre-commit for commit messages

_new in 0.15.4_ pre-commit can be used to manage `commit-msg` hooks.  Simply
`pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`.

`commit-msg` hooks can be configured by setting `stages: [commit-msg]`.
`commit-msg` hooks will be passed a single filename -- this file contains the
current contents of the commit message which can be validated.  If a hook
exits nonzero, the commit will be aborted.

## Confining hooks to run at certain stages

If pre-commit during push has been installed, then all hooks (by default) will
be run during the `push` stage.  Hooks can however be confined to a stage by
setting the `stages` property in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.  The
`stages` property is an array and can contain any of `commit`, `push`, and
`commit-msg`.

_new in 1.8.0_ An additional `manual` stage is available for one off execution
that won't run in any hook context.  This special stage is useful for taking
advantage of `pre-commit`'s cross-platform / cross-language package management
without running it on every commit.  Hooks confied to `stages: [manual]` can
be executed by running `pre-commit run --hook-stage manual <hookid>`.

## Passing arguments to hooks

Sometimes hooks require arguments to run correctly. You can pass static
arguments by specifying the `args` property in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
as follows:

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v1.2.3
    hooks:
    -   id: flake8
        args: [--max-line-length=131]
```

This will pass `--max-line-length=131` to `flake8`.

### Arguments pattern in hooks

If you are writing your own custom hook, your hook should expect to receive
the `args` value and then a list of staged files.

For example, assuming a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/path/to/your/hook/repo
    rev: badf00ddeadbeef
    hooks:
    -   id: my-hook-script-id
        args: [--myarg1=1, --myarg1=2]
```

When you next run `pre-commit`, your script will be called:

```
path/to/script-or-system-exe --myarg1=1 --myarg1=2 dir/file1 dir/file2 file3
```

If the `args` property is empty or not defined, your script will be called:

```
path/to/script-or-system-exe dir/file1 dir/file2 file3
```

## Repository local hooks

Repository-local hooks are useful when:

- The scripts are tightly coupled to the repository and it makes sense to
  distribute the hook scripts with the repository.
- Hooks require state that is only present in a built artifact of your
  repository (such as your app's virtualenv for pylint).
- The official repository for a linter doesn't have the pre-commit metadata.

You can configure repository-local hooks by specifying the `repo` as the
sentinel `local`.

_new in 0.13.0_ repository hooks can use any language which supports
`additional_dependencies` or `docker_image` / `pcre` / `pygrep` / `script` /
`system`.
This enables you to install things which previously would require a trivial
mirror repository.

A `local` hook must define `id`, `name`, `language`, `entry`, and `files` /
`types` as specified under [Creating new hooks](#new-hooks).

Here's an example configuration with a few `local` hooks:

```yaml
-   repo: local
    hooks:
    -   id: pylint
        name: pylint
        entry: python -m pylint.__main__
        language: system
        types: [python]
    -   id: check-x
        name: Check X
        entry: ./bin/check-x.sh
        language: script
        files: \.x$
    -   id: scss-lint
        name: scss-lint
        entry: scss-lint
        language: ruby
        language_version: 2.1.5
        types: [scss]
        additional_dependencies: ['scss_lint:0.52.0']
```

## Filtering files with types

_new in 0.15.0_


Filtering with `types` provides several advantages over traditional filtering
with `files`.

- no error-prone regular expressions
- files can be matched by their shebang (even when extensionless)
- symlinks / submodules can be easily ignored

`types` is specified per hook as an array of tags.  The tags are discovered
through a set of heuristics by the
[identify](https://github.com/chriskuehl/identify) library.  `identify` was
chosen as it is a small portable pure Python library.

Some of the common tags you'll find from identify:

- `file`
- `symlink`
- `directory` - in the context of pre-commit this will be a submodule
- `executable` - whether the file has the executable bit set
- `text` - whether the file looks like a text file
- `binary` - whether the file looks like a binary file
- [tags by extension / naming convention](https://github.com/chriskuehl/identify/blob/master/identify/extensions.py)
- [tags by shebang (`#!`)](https://github.com/chriskuehl/identify/blob/master/identify/interpreters.py)

To discovery the type of any file on disk, you can use `identify`'s cli:

```console
$ identify-cli setup.py
["file", "non-executable", "python", "text"]
$ identify-cli some-random-file
["file", "non-executable", "text"]
$ identify-cli --filename-only some-random-file; echo $?
1
```

If a file extension you use is not supported, please
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/chriskuehl/identify)!

`types` and `files` are evaluated with `AND` when filtering.  Tags within
`types` are also evaluated using `AND`.

For example:

```yaml
    files: ^foo/
    types: [file, python]
```

will match a file `foo/1.py` but will not match `setup.py`.

Files can also be matched by shebang.  With `types: python`, an `exe` starting
with `#!/usr/bin/env python3` will also be matched.

As with `files` and `exclude`, you can also exclude types if necessary using
`exclude_types`.

If you'd like to use `types` with compatibility for older versions
[here is a guide to ensuring compatibility](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/pull/551#issuecomment-312535540).

## Regular expressions

The patterns for `files` and `exclude` are Python
[regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax).

As such, you can use any of the features that Python regexes support.

If you find that your regular expression is becoming unwieldy due to a long
list of excluded / included things, you may find a
[verbose](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.VERBOSE) regular
expression useful.  One can enable this with yaml's  multiline literals and
the `(?x)` regex flag.

```yaml
# ...
    -   id: my-hook
        exclude: >
            (?x)^(
                path/to/file1.py|
                path/to/file2.py|
                path/to/file3.py
            )$
```

## Overriding language version

Sometimes you only want to run the hooks on a specific version of the
language. For each language, they default to using the system installed
language (So for example if I’m running `python2.7` and a hook specifies
`python`, pre-commit will run the hook using `python2.7`). Sometimes you
don’t want the default system installed version so you can override this on a
per-hook basis by setting the `language_version`.

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-scss-lint
    rev: v0.54.0
    hooks:
    -   id: scss-lint
        language_version: 2.1.5
```

This tells pre-commit to use ruby `2.1.5` to run the `scss-lint` hook.

Valid values for specific languages are listed below:
- python: Whatever system installed Python interpreters you have. The value of
  this argument is passed as the `-p` to `virtualenv`.
    - _new in 1.4.3_: on Windows the
      [pep394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/) name will be
      translated into a py launcher call for portability.  So continue to use
      names like `python3` (`py -3`) or `python3.6` (`py -3.6`) even on
      Windows.
- node: See [nodeenv](https://github.com/ekalinin/nodeenv#advanced).
- ruby: See [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/tree/master/share/ruby-build).

## Usage in continuous integration

pre-commit can also be used as a tool for continuous integration.  For
instance, adding `pre-commit run --all-files` as a CI step will ensure
everything stays in tip-top shape.  To check only files which have changed,
which may be faster, use something like
`git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r $REVISION | xargs pre-commit run --files`.

## Usage with tox

[tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/) is useful for configuring test / CI tools
such as pre-commit.  One feature of `tox>=2` is it will clear environment
variables such that tests are more reproducible.  Under some conditions,
pre-commit requires a few environment variables and so they must be
whitelisted.

When cloning repos over ssh (`repo: git@github.com:...`), `git` requires the
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` variable and will otherwise fail:

```
[INFO] Initializing environment for git@github.com:pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks.
An unexpected error has occurred: CalledProcessError: Command: ('/usr/bin/git', 'clone', '--no-checkout', 'git@github.com:pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks', '/home/asottile/.cache/pre-commit/repofdkwkq_v')
Return code: 128
Expected return code: 0
Output: (none)
Errors:
    Cloning into '/home/asottile/.cache/pre-commit/repofdkwkq_v'...
    Permission denied (publickey).
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.


Check the log at /home/asottile/.cache/pre-commit/pre-commit.log
```

Add the following to your tox testenv:

```ini
[testenv]
passenv = SSH_AUTH_SOCK
```

pre-commit uses `os.path.expanduser` to create the cache directory, on Windows
this requires the `HOMEPATH` environment variable:

```ini
[testenv]
passenv = HOMEPATH
```

Or with both:

```ini
[testenv]
passenv = HOMEPATH SSH_AUTH_SOCK
```

## Using the latest version for a repository

`pre-commit` configuration aims to give a repeatable and fast experience and
therefore intentionally doesn't provide facilities for "unpinned latest
version" for hook repositories.

Instead, `pre-commit` provides tools to make it easy to upgrade to the
latest versions with [`pre-commit autoupdate`](#pre-commit-autoupdate).  If
you need the absolute latest version of a hook (instead of the latest tagged
version), pass the `--bleeding-edge` parameter to `autoupdate`.

`pre-commit` assumes that the value of `rev` is an immutable ref (such as a
tag or SHA) and will cache based on that.  Using a branch name (or `HEAD`) for
the value of `rev` is not supported and will only represent the state of
that mutable ref at the time of hook installation (and will *NOT* update
automatically).
